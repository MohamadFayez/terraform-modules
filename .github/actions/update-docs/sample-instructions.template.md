## Setup Instructions

Set the project ID where you want your Apigee Organization to be deployed to:

```sh
PROJECT_ID=my-project-id
```

```sh
cd samples/... # Sample from above
cp ./x-demo.tfvars ./my-config.tfvars
```

Decide on a [backend](https://www.terraform.io/language/settings/backends) and create the necessary config. To use a backend on Google Cloud Storage (GCS) use:

```sh
gsutil mb "gs://$PROJECT_ID-tf"

cat <<EOF >terraform.tf
terraform {
  backend "gcs" {
    bucket  = "$PROJECT_ID-tf"
    prefix  = "terraform/state"
  }
}
EOF
```

Validate your config:

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan --var-file=./my-config.tfvars -var "project_id=$PROJECT_ID"
```

and provision everything (takes roughly 25min):

```sh
terraform apply --var-file=./my-config.tfvars -var "project_id=$PROJECT_ID"
```
